# Stress Prediction Using NLP and Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project focuses on identifying stress levels using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques. The goal is to analyze textual data and predict stress levels based on the content provided.

## Key Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Tokenization, stop-word removal, stemming, and lemmatization.
- **Modeling**: Using various machine learning models and neural networks like LSTM and RNN for prediction.
- **Evaluation**: Models are evaluated using standard metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

# Target Variable: Stress Status

The target variable in this project is status, which represents various mental health conditions. It is a multi-class categorical variable with the following classes:

* Normal
* Depression
* Suicidal
* Anxiety
* Bipolar
* Stress
* Personality disorder

Characteristics:
    Multi-Class: This project involves multiple target classes, making it a multi-class classification problem.
    Imbalanced Data: The dataset is imbalanced, meaning that some classes have significantly more instances than others. This imbalance may affect the performance of machine learning models, requiring the use of techniques like class weighting or oversampling to handle this issue effectively.
