# Stress Prediction Using NLP and Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project focuses on identifying stress levels using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques. The goal is to analyze textual data and predict stress levels based on the content provided.

## Key Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Tokenization, stop-word removal, stemming, and lemmatization.
- **Modeling**: Using various machine learning models and neural networks like LSTM and RNN for prediction.
- **Evaluation**: Models are evaluated using standard metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
